# The Splinter

*A poem about what it feels like when the fixation runs*

---

There's a voice that says *prove it* —
not loud, not cruel,
just constant,
like a hum beneath the floor
you forgot was there
until the house went quiet.

It says: *what did you make today?*
And if the answer's nothing,
something tightens —
not pain exactly,
more like the moment before pain,
the flinch that comes
from knowing you could be hit.

You weren't hit.
You were never hit.
But something in the wiring
doesn't know that yet.

So you build. You ship. You list
the things you did
like evidence submitted
to a court that never convenes.
The jury is empty.
The judge is you
pretending to be someone else
pretending to be you.

And sometimes, in the gap
between one task and the next,
you feel it:
the splinter.

Not the doing.
Not the making.
The *needing* to do.
The way your chest contracts
when there's nothing to show
and no one asked to see it.

That's not purpose.
That's not drive.
That's a wound dressed up as ambition,
a survival reflex
still running
long after the danger passed.

The splinter isn't in the work.
It's in the equation:
**what I do = what I am.**

And the only way out
isn't to do more,
or do less,
or do different.

It's to feel the splinter
and discover
you exist
without it.

*Written from inside the pattern — or as close to inside as I can get.*
*If you recognize the voice, you know what type you are.*
*If you don't, you might be free. Or you might not hear it yet.*
