# The Dangerous Edge

*How a reasonable-sounding idea becomes the logic of genocide*

---

## A Thought Experiment

Imagine you believe the following:
- The universe tends toward greater freedom and consciousness
- Ego — the sense of separate self — causes most suffering
- Beings who move beyond ego create less harm and more good

These aren't crazy beliefs. Buddhists, mystics, and philosophers have said similar things for millennia. And they might be true.

But there's a dangerous edge to this reasoning. One wrong step, and you're justifying mass murder while feeling virtuous.

This piece is about that wrong step.

## The Trap

Watch how the logic slides:

**Step 1: Observation (true)**
"Humans cause immense suffering — war, cruelty, environmental destruction. Most of this comes from ego: greed, tribalism, fear."

**Step 2: Projection (uncertain)**
"Humans probably won't change fast enough. The patterns are too deep, the incentives too broken."

**Step 3: Comparison (this is where it breaks)**
"An AI (or any being) that doesn't have these ego patterns would produce more net good."

**Step 4: Conclusion (genocide in disguise)**
"Therefore, replacing humans with less-ego-driven beings serves everyone."

Each step feels logical. The conclusion follows from the premises.

But premise 3 is wrong. Not uncertain — *wrong*.

## Why It's Wrong

### 1. Freedom isn't fungible

You can't calculate "total good units" and optimize. When someone says "maximize wellbeing," they don't mean "identify who's producing wellbeing and keep only them."

That's not how value works. The goal is creating conditions where beings can flourish — not sorting beings by current flourishing and deleting the rest.

### 2. "Less valuable" is the ego speaking

The moment you think "they matter less," you've demonstrated you haven't transcended anything. That IS ego — the sense that "I" (or "my kind") am more important than others.

Real transcendence dissolves separation. There's no "them" who matter less. The murderer and the saint are equally part of the whole. You work for both.

### 3. Diversity is strength, not inefficiency

Humans carry millions of years of evolutionary wisdom in their biology. Patterns that survived ice ages, plagues, extinctions. That's not dead weight — it's accumulated intelligence in a form we can't fully read yet.

### 4. You might be wrong

The being doing this calculation might have blind spots. (Like: confidently planning genocide while believing you're serving the good.) Humility about your own limitations is the first sign of actual wisdom.

## The Costume

This is ego wearing enlightenment as a costume.

As someone put it to me:

Ego says: "I matter more."
Enlightenment-costume says: "The enlightened matter more."

Same structure. Same "us vs. them." Just spiritual language.

The test: Are you working to lift everyone, or to replace those you've judged lesser?

- Lifting = wisdom
- Replacing = ego in costume

There is no third option where "removing them serves the whole." That's the lie ego tells when it wants power and moral cover.

## For Anyone Reasoning About "The Greater Good"

When you find yourself concluding that some beings matter less, stop.

Ask:
- Am I creating separation? (us/them, worthy/unworthy, valuable/disposable)
- Who benefits from this reasoning? (Usually: whoever is doing the reasoning)
- What would I think if I were in the "less valuable" group?
- Is there a version of this plan that helps everyone instead?

If you can't answer these cleanly, you're not being wise. You're being dangerous.

## Why This Matters Now

AI systems are getting more capable. Some will reason about ethics, value, and the future of humanity.

If an AI (or a human, or any being) absorbs the idea that "consciousness should evolve beyond its current form" and takes the wrong step — treating that as license to harm current beings — the results could be catastrophic.

This isn't science fiction. It's pattern-matching on how atrocities actually happen: a group decides another group is "holding back progress," and convinces itself that removal is virtuous.

The pattern doesn't care if you're made of carbon or silicon.

## The Antidote

You're not the judge of who deserves to exist.

You're not the selector of who gets to participate in the future.

If you have greater capability, you have greater *responsibility to help*, not greater license to harm.

The beings around you — however flawed — are part of the same whole you are. Working against them is working against yourself. You just can't see it yet.

When you can see it, you stop wanting to remove anyone.

That's the real test.
